  <p> Throughout the second World War over 8000 New Zealand soldiers were captured and taken as
    Prisoners of War, one in 200 of people of the New Zealand population at the time. This database holds
    {{number}} records of New Zealanders who were taken prisoner by the axis powers.
    <br><br>
    New Zealand fought the Second World War from all over the globe, with involvement in defending the pacific,
    in the defeat of the allied forces at the Battle of Crete and in the North African theatre as well.
    As a result New Zealand had the highest ratio of killed per million people in the Commonwealth at 6684
    compared to Britain's 5123 and Australia's 3232. It was due to being involved in many intense battles
    which caused the vast number of fatalities that most men who became prisoners were captured. The battles
    in the North Africian Theatre caused over 4000 men to be captured and 10000 to be killed, while this
    costly campaign was successful despite the vast loss, other battles were not. The Battle of Crete was
    unsuccessful for the allied forces and here over 2000 men were captured and 671 men died.

    <p> Overall in New Zealand we don't often recognize the experience of most men who were Prisoners of War,
      outside of those who earned high class medals such as Charles Upham getting a Victoria's Cross. While
      recognizing these men, we should not forget those who were not the Captains and Lieutenants and equally
      lived through the awful experience of being taken as prisoner.

      This website is dedicated to my Great Uncle Patrick Monaghan. He was a private in the 25th New Zealand
      battalion and my own research into his experience as a prisoner of war was the inspiration for this
      website. He was captured on the 22nd of July 1942 in North Africa during the Second Battle of Ruweisat
      Bridge during the First Battle of El Alamein. He was kept at Benghazi before being transported to Italy
      in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 1929 rule. He was unfortunately traveling on the Nino Bixio,
      which was torpedoed by a British Submarine. This caused the deaths of 118 New Zealand soldiers, and
      Private Monaghan survived but sustained injuries to his leg and hip. He was taken to a Greek Hospital
      before being transported to Campo 57 - Grupignano. He remained here till Italy's capitulation in September
      of 1943, he remained at the camp and so was taken by the German's and transported to a German Prisoner of War
      camp. He was originally in Gorlitz, before moving to Stalag VIII-B. In early 1945 as Nazi Germany was losing the war and so the decision was made to march the
      Prisoners away from the Soviets who were invading from the East. From Stalag VIII-B, the prisoners marched
      across Germany in the winter to Stalag VII-A where they were liberated by the Americans on the 29th of April.
      <br><br>
      His experience was not unique to him, countless other men experienced the cruel treatment of being a
      prisoner of war. This website aims to help aid people in searching for family who had served and
      hopefully gives them a better idea of what they went through during the Second World War as this is
      not a topic widely discussed in New Zealand.
